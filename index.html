            <p>I am not really sure what to put here. I was born in Arizona, where I lived in various parts of the state until I was roughly 14. After that I spent my formative years in Panama City Beach, FL. I originally moved to Colorado when I was 19 because my brother lived here and we were split up at a young age, he ended up being raised by our grandparents and I was bounced around. I then bounced back between Florida, Arizona, and Colorado before finally settling on Colorado. I attended CU Boulder where I double majored in Psychology and Sociology. I wanted to originally be a social worker, focusing on child protective services, since without them I likely would not be here today. After school I did a few stints as a customer service professional. Turns out I am pretty good at talking to people on the phone. However, it is not something I want to spend my life doing.</p>

            <p>I find myself getting involved in probably far to many projects. I am currently the vocalist for the band Transmission. At the moment we are focusing on tightening up our songs so that we can get a professional recording. I like to do Youtube unboxing videos for geek related subscription boxes. I am a huge football fan, particularly of the Denver Broncos. I try to go to at least one game a year and was present at each of the games Manning broke a record. My favorite player is Rod Smith. I also like to play competitive multiplayer games. My current go to game is Overwatch, where I play support , generally Mercy. Although if the Halo Wars 2 Blitz beta is anything to go by, I will likely be switching back and forth between that and Overwatch once it releases.</p>
            <p>I enjoy collecting items. Right now my focus has been on various Funko items as well as video games in general. For some reason, to me, it is more fun to collect them than it is to play them. I like reading in my spare time as well. I try to split my time reading non-fiction books and young adult fiction. I also like James Patterson books. His way of having chapters be just a few pages make them quite easy to digest. My juvenile delinquency professor had us read the Alex Cross novels for extra credit and I was quickly hooked. I also enjoy picking up a guitar and singing to the dogs. Playing music has a way of relaxing me. I am also getting back into working out after not being able to do so for a year.</p>
